        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            I am Robert Santiago, a dual enrollment student at Cerritos College for the past two years. I attend John Glenn High School and will be entering my senior year at the start of this school year. I am excited about the upcoming robotics competition between all the high schools in my district. After high school, I hope to attend MIT to major in computer science, as I want to be at the forefront of technology and innovation in artificial intelligence and robotics. My passion for technology drives me to explore and create in this ever-evolving field.
