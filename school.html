            I am currently a senior at John Glenn High School, where I have been actively involved in various volunteering clubs holding the position of president and treasury in those respective clubs. I am also the lead programmer and builder for my schoolâ€™s robotics team. My goal is to graduate as valedictorian, which requires maintaining excellent grades across all subjects. John Glenn High School has provided me with a strong foundation in mathematics, science, and computer science courses that have prepared me for my future studies.

                For the past two years, I have been participating in the dual enrollment program at Cerritos College. This program allows me to take college-level courses while still in high school, giving me a head start on my higher education. I've completed several courses that will transfer to my future university, including advanced mathematics, computer science fundamentals, and general education requirements.

            <p>
                After graduating from John Glenn High School, my plan is to attend MIT to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence and robotics, as these fields represent the cutting edge of technology innovation.
